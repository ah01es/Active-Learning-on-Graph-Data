# Active-Learning-on-Graph-Data
This project implements the Active Learning by Feature Mixing method (AlphaMixSampling) from Amin Parvaneh's paper, applied to graph data, specifically the Cora dataset. The focus is on improving clustering accuracy via active learning strategies enhanced by feature mixing.
